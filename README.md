# Windows Event Log samples for practising information gathering, analysis, working with SIEMs etc... 

Large collection processed in different formats for easier importing - **evtx, json, csv**
Just take your pick (large, small, specific activity, specific attack, entire APT) and try to investigate suspicious activities with your favorite tools or manualy.
Some of the logs have associated **pcap** files.

It is possible that some of the evtx files are corrupted. If you find a corrupted file I recommend to look for equivelent in Csv folder and use Structured Data as a source type to import to a SIEM.
